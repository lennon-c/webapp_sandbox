This is a set of personal exploratory tests with the [`Streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/) library for building web applications.

Here are some examples:
-  [Classifiers](https://webappsandbox-clennon.streamlit.app/Classifiers), which was created as part of a project on Coursera: [Build a Machine Learning Web App with Streamlit and Python](https://www.coursera.org/projects/machine-learning-streamlit-python).
- [Dashboard](https://webappsandbox-clennon.streamlit.app/Dashboard) based on the Coursera project [Create Interactive Dashboards with Streamlit and Python](https://www.coursera.org/projects/interactive-dashboards-streamlit-python)

So far, I have found `Streamlit` extremely easy to use and deploy.

- The web app is hosted on `Streamlit Cloud` and is updated whenever changes are pushed to my remote repository on GitHub.

- The app currently works on tablets and PCs but not on mobile phones. In theory, it should work on mobile devices as well.
